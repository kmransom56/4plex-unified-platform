### PERSONAL STATEMENT

*Please provide a brief statement about your military service, your housing needs, and how this grant will help you achieve homeownership (250 words or less):*

As a veteran who served [number] years in the [branch of service], I am seeking to purchase a multifamily property at 2072 E Roxboro Rd NE in Brookhaven, GA. This property will allow me to establish stable housing for myself while also providing affordable rental units to others in the community.

The property requires significant renovation to improve energy efficiency and overall quality. I plan to occupy one unit as my primary residence and rent the other units to help offset the mortgage costs. This strategy will help me build financial security while providing quality housing options in the Brookhaven community.

The Dream Makers grant would significantly help with closing costs, allowing me to reserve more of my savings for necessary property improvements. Combined with my VA loan benefit and other assistance programs, this grant would make homeownership financially sustainable and help me transition successfully to civilian life through real estate investment.

I am committed to being a responsible homeowner and landlord, and I look forward to using the skills I developed during my military service to maintain and improve this property for years to come.

### CERTIFICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

I authorize the PenFed Foundation and its agents to verify any information contained in this application, including but not limited to employment, income, assets, and veteran status.

I understand that this grant is contingent upon my contribution of at least $500 of my own funds toward the home purchase, completion of a homebuyer education course, and use of the property as my primary residence.
