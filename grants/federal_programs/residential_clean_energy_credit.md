# Residential Clean Energy Credit (Federal Tax Credit)
## Application Information

### Program Overview
The Residential Clean Energy Credit (formerly known as the Investment Tax Credit or ITC) is a federal tax incentive that allows property owners to deduct 30% of the cost of installing solar energy systems from their federal taxes. The Inflation Reduction Act extended this credit at 30% through 2032.

### Eligibility
- **Property Types**: Residential properties, including small multifamily buildings (2-4 units)
- **System Requirements**: Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, solar water heating, fuel cells, small wind energy, and geothermal heat pumps
- **Installation Timeline**: Systems must be placed in service during the tax year for which the credit is claimed
- **Ownership Requirement**: You must own the system (not lease)

### Application Process
This is a tax credit, not a grant, so the "application" is part of your tax filing:

1. **Installation Documentation**:
   - Keep all receipts and contracts related to the solar installation
   - Document the date the system was placed in service

2. **Tax Filing**:
   - Complete IRS Form 5695 (Residential Energy Credits)
   - Calculate your credit amount
   - Include with your annual tax return

### Required Documentation
- Receipts for all costs related to the solar installation
- Certification statement from the manufacturer confirming the equipment qualifies
- Contractor documentation showing installation date and system specifications
- Interconnection agreement with utility company (if grid-connected)
- Energy audit or solar assessment (recommended but not required)

### Funding Amount
- 30% of qualified solar electric property costs with no maximum limit
- For a $20,000 solar installation, the tax credit would be $6,000

### Important Deadlines
- Credit must be claimed for the tax year in which the system was "placed in service"
- If you can't use the entire credit in one year, the excess can be carried forward to the next tax year
- 30% rate available through December 31, 2032
- 26% rate for 2033
- 22% rate for 2034
- Credit expires after 2034 unless extended by Congress

### Special Considerations for Multifamily Properties
- For small multifamily properties (2-4 units) where you live in one unit:
  - The entire system may qualify for the residential credit
- For rental-only properties:
  - May need to use the Commercial Clean Energy Credit (Section 48) instead
  - Consult with a tax professional for your specific situation

### Combining with Other Incentives
- Can be combined with state and local incentives
- Utility rebates may be considered taxable income, affecting the basis for the tax credit
- Combining with CDBG grants may require careful calculation of eligible costs
