# EPA's Solar for All Program
## Application Information

### Program Overview
The Solar for All program is funded through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). It provides $7 billion in competitive grants to states, municipalities, Tribal governments, and eligible nonprofits to enable low-income and disadvantaged communities to benefit from residential solar.

### Eligibility
- **For Property Owners**: While property owners don't apply directly to the EPA, they can participate in programs funded by Solar for All grants
- **For Multifamily Properties**: Small multifamily properties (2-4 units) can qualify if they serve low-income or disadvantaged communities
- **Geographic Requirements**: Properties must be located in areas served by a Solar for All grant recipient

### Application Process
As a property owner, you don't apply directly to the EPA. Instead:

1. **Identify Local Program Administrator**: 
   - Check if Georgia or DeKalb County has received Solar for All funding
   - Contact the Georgia Environmental Protection Division or DeKalb County Sustainability Office

2. **Program Participation**:
   - Once you identify the local program administrator, apply to their specific program
   - Each program will have its own application process and requirements
