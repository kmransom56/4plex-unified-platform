## Specific Negotiation Scripts

### Initial Offer Presentation
```
"My client is a military veteran with a strong VA loan pre-approval of $650,000. They're very interested in the property at 2072 E Roxboro Rd NE and prepared to move forward with an offer of $565,000 with the seller covering 3% ($16,950) in closing costs.

This structure benefits the seller by providing a clean sale to a qualified buyer while still netting $548,050. The property's age and condition issues, particularly [specific issues], justify this approach rather than a lower purchase price.

My client is flexible on the closing timeline and willing to accommodate the seller's preferred schedule. We've included a VA pre-approval letter and proof of funds for remaining closing costs."
```

### Inspection Negotiation Script
```
"Based on the inspection results, we've identified several issues that weren't apparent during our initial viewings. These include [list major issues] with estimated repair costs of [amount].

Rather than requesting repairs or a price reduction, my client is willing to handle these issues themselves if the seller can increase the closing cost contribution to 4% ($23,000). This approach simplifies the transaction for the seller while addressing legitimate concerns about the property's condition."
```

### Appraisal Negotiation Script
```
"The VA appraisal has come in at [amount], which is [difference] below the contract price. Since VA loans can only be made up to the appraised value, we need to address this gap.

We propose adjusting the purchase price to match the appraised value of [amount] while maintaining the seller's concession at 4% of this new price. This approach satisfies VA requirements while still moving forward with the transaction."
```

### Final Negotiation Script
```
"My client remains very interested in purchasing this property and wants to find a solution that works for both parties. We can be flexible on [closing date/minor repair requests/etc.] if we can reach agreement on the critical closing cost assistance of [amount].

This property represents an important investment for a veteran who has served our country, and the seller's assistance with these costs would be greatly appreciated and would allow us to move forward immediately with the purchase."
