### Tips for a Successful Application

1. **Clearly demonstrate need**: Document the current condition of the property with photos and inspection reports
2. **Focus on energy efficiency**: Highlight energy efficiency components of your rehabilitation plan
3. **Leverage other funding**: Show that CDBG funds will be combined with other sources (private investment, other grants)
4. **Community impact**: Explain how the project will benefit the broader neighborhood
5. **Long-term sustainability**: Detail your plan for maintaining affordability and property condition
6. **Readiness to proceed**: Demonstrate that your project can begin quickly once funds are awarded

### Common Reasons for Application Rejection

1. Incomplete application
2. Failure to demonstrate financial capacity
3. Unrealistic project timeline
4. Insufficient benefit to low-income residents
5. Poor track record with previous grants
6. Project not aligned with county priorities

### Combining with Clean Energy Initiatives

CDBG funds can be strategically combined with clean energy incentives:

1. Use CDBG for basic rehabilitation and structural improvements
2. Leverage Georgia Power rebates for energy efficiency upgrades
3. Apply federal tax credits for solar installation
4. Utilize Georgia's Home Energy Rebates for additional energy improvements

This layered approach can significantly reduce the out-of-pocket costs for comprehensive property improvements.
